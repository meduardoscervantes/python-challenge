# python-challenge
This repository contains two directories, PyBank and PyPoll. 
Each repository contains a resources repository with the associated .CSV data files needed for the python program to run.

The PyBank program is written in python and analyzes the data from its .CSV file and outputs information from the data and generates a .txt file with the results


The PyPoll program is written in python and counts up the total votes from a small public vote. The program will generate a .txt file with the output of the election.
